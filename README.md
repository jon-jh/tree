Tree traversal is a powerful technique for solving real-world problems involving hierarchical data structures, such as organization charts. Here are some key applications:

- Counting Employees: By traversing the tree, you can count the total number of employees under a specific manager, including direct and indirect reports.
- Finding Specific Employees: You can search for employees meeting certain criteria, such as those earning above a specific salary, by traversing the tree and checking each node.
- Calculating Department Costs: Traversing the tree allows you to sum the salaries of all employees in a department to determine the total cost.
- Hierarchy Analysis: Tree traversal helps in understanding the structure and hierarchy within an organization, such as identifying all subordinates under a particular manager.
- These tasks are accomplished using either Breadth First Traversal or Depth First Traversal, depending on the specific requirements.
